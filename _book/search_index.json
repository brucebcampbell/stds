This is an important task in quantifying the uncertainty in which target variables can be predicted from their inputs. Sobol indices (Saltelli and Sobol’ 1995) are a popular approach to this. It turns out that there’s a relationship between Sobol indices and Shapley values. We explore this relationship here and demonstrate their effectiveness on some linear and non-linear models. 4.1 Relationship between Sobol indices and Shapley values Shapley values are based on \\(f(x)-E[f(x)]\\) while Sobol indices decompose output variance into fractions contributed by the inputs. The Sobol index is a global measure of feature importance while Shapley values focus on local explanations although we could combine local Shapley values to achieve a global importance measure. Sobol indices are based on expectations and can be used for features not included in the model / function of interest. In this way we could query for important features correlated with those that the model does use. 4.2 CRAN sensitivity package library(ggplot2) library(pander) if(!require(sensitivity)){ install.packages(&quot;sensitivity&quot;) library(sensitivity) } Standardized Regression Coefficients (SRC), or the Standardized Rank Regression Coefficients (SRRC), which are sensitivity indices based on linear or monotonic assumptions in the case of independent factors. n &lt;- 100 X &lt;- data.frame(X1 = runif(n, 0.5, 1.5), X2 = runif(n, 1.5, 4.5), X3 = runif(n, 4.5, 13.5)) # linear model : Y = X1 + X2 + X3 y &lt;- with(X, X1 + X2 + X3) Z &lt;- src(X, y, rank = FALSE, logistic = FALSE, nboot = 0, conf = 0.95) pander(Z$SRC,caption = &quot;Standardized Regression Coefficients &quot;) Standardized Regression Coefficients   original X1 0.1168 X2 0.3041 X3 0.9458 ggplot(Z, ylim = c(-1,1))+ggtitle(&quot;Standardized Regression Coefficients&quot;) y &lt;- with(X, X1 + X2 + X3) y &lt;- y + rnorm(nrow(X),0,1/2) df&lt;- data.frame(cbind(X,y)) Z &lt;- src(X, y, rank = FALSE, logistic = FALSE, nboot = 0, conf = 0.95) pander(Z$SRC,caption = &quot;Standardized Regression Coefficients &quot;) Standardized Regression Coefficients   original X1 0.1392 X2 0.2987 X3 0.9278 ggplot(Z, ylim = c(-1,1))+ggtitle(&quot;Standardized Regression Coefficients&quot;) #lm.fit = lm(y ~ X1+X2+X3,data = df) #summary(lm.fit) #attach(df) #plot(y, X1+X2+X3) We see how the importance of X3 is ranked above X2 and likewise X2 is more important than X1. This is by design of the simulated data set.
