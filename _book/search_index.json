This is an important task in quantifying the uncertainty in which target variables can be predicted from their inputs. Sobol indices are a popular approach to this. It turns out that there’s a relationship between Sobol indices and Shapley values. We explore this relationship here and demonstrate their effectiveness on some linear and non-linear models. 4.1 Relationship between Sobol indices and Shapley values Shapley values are based on \\(f(x)-E[f(x)]\\) while Sobol indices decompose output variance into fractions contributed by the inputs. The Sobol index is a global measure of feature importance while Shapley values focus on local explanations although we could combine local Shapley values to achieve a global importance measure. Sobol indices are based on expectations and can be used for features not included in the model / function of interest. In this way we could query for important features correlated with those that the model does use.
